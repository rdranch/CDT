# CDT

To install this malware, simply download pyinstaller, https://www.pyinstaller.org/, or use the command 'pip install pyinstaller' in your command prompt. From there, run the command: pyinstaller keychanger.pyw --onefile. This will compress all the required files into one executable (found in dist) where users can freely use and distribute it. There is no need to do anything past this as the file is a drag-and-drop and click-and-run program where it will automatically run.
